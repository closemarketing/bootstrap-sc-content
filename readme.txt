This WordPress plugin extends shortcodes to use in Bootstrap themes.

== Description ==
This plugin give you a bunch of shortcodes that allows you to draw content using Bootstrap CSS and HTML. 



> This plugin requires the <a href="http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/">Gravity Forms plugin</a>. <strong>Don't use Gravity Forms? <a href="http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/">Buy the plugin</a></strong> and start using this revolutionary plugin!

The [Gravity Forms](http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/) developers don't focus on translating
their plugin. Instead they concentrate on the core functionalities of the plugin itself.
Therefore there are regular updates of the Gravity Forms plugin. However, after each
automatic update, the manually placed Spanish translations are deleted. This plugin fixes
that issue for all the Spanish WordPress and Gravity Forms users!

Do you want to contribute to this translation? I’ve made a Glotpress Project in order to share it:
